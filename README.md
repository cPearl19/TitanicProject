First Kaggle Dataset i ever looked into: Predicting Titanic Survivors

This was the first dataset I where started investigating how to deal with missing data and learned about MCAR,MAR, vs MNAR. I tried to solve for missing age data 
using multiple imputation and compared that to building a quick GBM model to predict age. Haven't updated this in awhile but I would like to go back and add comments and fix it up a bit. EDA is towards the bottom.
